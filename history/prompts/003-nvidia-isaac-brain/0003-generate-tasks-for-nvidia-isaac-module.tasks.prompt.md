## Prompt

/sp.tasks (for Module 3)

## Response snapshot

Generated the task list for setting up the Docusaurus structure for Module 3.

- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: `specs/003-nvidia-isaac-brain/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The agent successfully generated a task list for a third module, demonstrating an understanding of how to extend the project with new features.
