# Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy

## Introduction to rclpy

In Chapter 1, we learned about the fundamental concepts of ROS 2: nodes, topics, and services. Now, we'll dive into implementing these concepts using Python, specifically with the `rclpy` client library.

`rclpy` is the official Python client library for ROS 2. It provides an idiomatic Python interface to the core ROS 2 functionalities, allowing you to easily create ROS 2 nodes and interact with the ROS 2 graph using Python. This is particularly useful for AI agents, as many AI algorithms are developed in Python.

## Creating a ROS 2 Node in Python

Every ROS 2 application starts with one or more nodes. Here's a basic structure for a Python node using `rclpy`:

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MinimalNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_node') # Initialize the node with a unique name
        self.get_logger().info('Minimal Node has been started!')

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)         # Initialize rclpy
    minimal_node = MinimalNode()  # Create an instance of our node
    rclpy.spin(minimal_node)      # Keep the node alive and processing events
    minimal_node.destroy_node()   # Destroy the node when done
    rclpy.shutdown()              # Shut down rclpy

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
*   `rclpy.init(args=args)`: Initializes the ROS 2 Python client library. This must be called before you can create any ROS 2 nodes.
*   `Node('minimal_node')`: Creates an instance of a `Node` with the name `'minimal_node'`. Node names must be unique within a ROS 2 domain.
*   `rclpy.spin(minimal_node)`: This call blocks the program and keeps the node alive, allowing it to process callbacks (e.g., from subscribers or timers).
*   `minimal_node.destroy_node()`: Cleans up the node.
*   `rclpy.shutdown()`: Shuts down the `rclpy` library.

## Publishers and Subscribers in Python

Let's implement the talker-listener example from Chapter 1 using `rclpy`.

### Python Publisher (Talker)

This node will publish string messages to a topic named `/topic`.

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String # Standard ROS 2 message type for strings

class MinimalPublisher(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10) # Topic name: 'topic', QoS profile: 10
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = f'Hello ROS 2! Count: {self.i}'
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: "{msg.data}"')
        self.i += 1

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_publisher = MinimalPublisher()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_publisher)
    minimal_publisher.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
*   `create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)`: Creates a publisher that will send `String` messages on the topic `'topic'` with a QoS (Quality of Service) history depth of 10.
*   `create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)`: Sets up a timer that calls `self.timer_callback` every `timer_period` seconds.

### Python Subscriber (Listener)

This node will subscribe to the `/topic` and print the messages it receives.

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MinimalSubscriber(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_subscriber')
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            String,
            'topic',
            self.listener_callback,
            10) # Topic name: 'topic', QoS profile: 10
        self.subscription  # prevent unused variable warning

    def listener_callback(self, msg):
        self.get_logger().info(f'I heard: "{msg.data}"')

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_subscriber = MinimalSubscriber()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_subscriber)
    minimal_subscriber.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
*   `create_subscription(String, 'topic', self.listener_callback, 10)`: Creates a subscriber that listens for `String` messages on the topic `'topic'`. When a message is received, `self.listener_callback` is executed.

To run these examples:
1.  Save the publisher code as `talker.py` and the subscriber code as `listener.py`.
2.  Open two separate terminals.
3.  In the first terminal, navigate to the directory containing your `talker.py` and run: `python3 talker.py`
4.  In the second terminal, navigate to the directory containing your `listener.py` and run: `python3 listener.py`
You should see messages being published by the talker and received by the listener.

## Services in Python

Now let's implement a simple service example. A service that adds two integers.

### Python Service Server

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from example_interfaces.srv import AddTwoInts # Custom service message type

class MinimalService(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_service')
        self.srv = self.create_service(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints', self.add_two_ints_callback)

    def add_two_ints_callback(self, request, response):
        response.sum = request.a + request.b
        self.get_logger().info(f'Incoming request: a={request.a} b={request.b}, sending back sum={response.sum}')
        return response

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_service = MinimalService()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_service)
    minimal_service.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
*   `create_service(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints', self.add_two_ints_callback)`: Creates a service named `'add_two_ints'` that expects `AddTwoInts` messages. When a request comes in, `self.add_two_ints_callback` is called.

### Python Service Client

```python
import sys
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from example_interfaces.srv import AddTwoInts

class MinimalClientAsync(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_client_async')
        self.cli = self.create_client(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints')
        while not self.cli.wait_for_service(timeout_sec=1.0):
            self.get_logger().info('service not available, waiting again...')
        self.req = AddTwoInts.Request()

    def send_request(self, a, b):
        self.req.a = a
        self.req.b = b
        self.future = self.cli.call_async(self.req)
        rclpy.spin_until_future_complete(self, self.future) # Wait for the response
        return self.future.result()

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_client = MinimalClientAsync()
    response = minimal_client.send_request(int(sys.argv[1]), int(sys.argv[2]))
    minimal_client.get_logger().info(
        f'Result of add_two_ints: for {sys.argv[1]} + {sys.argv[2]} = {response.sum}')
    minimal_client.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
*   `create_client(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints')`: Creates a client for the `'add_two_ints'` service.
*   `wait_for_service()`: The client waits until the service server is available.
*   `call_async(self.req)`: Sends the request asynchronously.
*   `rclpy.spin_until_future_complete(self, self.future)`: Blocks until the service response is received.

To run these examples:
1.  Save the service code as `service.py` and the client code as `client.py`.
2.  Open two separate terminals.
3.  In the first terminal, navigate to the directory containing your `service.py` and run: `python3 service.py`
4.  In the second terminal, navigate to the directory containing your `client.py` and run: `python3 client.py 2 3` (where 2 and 3 are the integers to add).
You should see the service processing the request and the client receiving the sum.

## AI Agent to Controller Communication Flow

Imagine an AI agent written in Python that needs to control a robot. `rclpy` provides the bridge:
*   **Perception (Sensors to AI)**: Sensor nodes (e.g., camera, lidar) publish data to ROS 2 topics. The AI agent (a `rclpy` node) subscribes to these topics to receive the raw or processed sensor data.
*   **Decision Making (AI Processing)**: The AI agent processes this data using its internal logic (e.g., object detection, path planning, reinforcement learning).
*   **Action (AI to Controller)**: Based on its decisions, the AI agent needs to send commands to the robot's actuators. This can happen in a few ways:
    *   **Topics**: For continuous control commands (e.g., publishing desired velocities to a `/cmd_vel` topic).
    *   **Services**: For discrete, one-off commands that require confirmation (e.g., calling a `/gripper/open` service or `/move_to_waypoint` service).

This robust communication framework allows complex AI algorithms to be developed independently and then integrated seamlessly into the robot's control system through ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services.

## Summary

This chapter provided a hands-on introduction to `rclpy`, the Python client library for ROS 2. We learned how to:
*   Create basic ROS 2 nodes.
*   Implement publishers and subscribers for asynchronous topic communication.
*   Implement service servers and clients for synchronous request/response interactions.
*   Understand the typical communication flow between a Python-based AI agent and a robot controller via ROS 2.

With this knowledge, you are now equipped to start building your own Python-based ROS 2 applications for robotic control. In the next chapter, we will explore how robots' physical structures are described using URDF.
