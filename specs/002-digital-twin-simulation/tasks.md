# Tasks: Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-digital-twin-simulation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Tests**: Not applicable for this structural setup. Validation will be done by building the site.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Paths shown below assume a Docusaurus project at the repository root.

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure.

*This phase was completed during the setup for Module 1. No new tasks are required.*

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented.

*This phase was completed during the setup for Module 1. The autogenerated sidebar will automatically pick up the new module directory.*

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create Module 2 Structure and Chapter 1 (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Create the directory structure for Module 2 and add the placeholder file for the first chapter, making it visible in the site navigation.
**Independent Test**: The Docusaurus site builds successfully (`npm run build`), and a link to "Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo" is visible and clickable in the sidebar under the "Module 2" category.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T001 [P] [US1] Create the directory `docs/module2-digital-twin`.
- [X] T002 [US1] Create the category file `docs/module2-digital-twin/_category_.json` to label the module "Module 2: The Digital Twin".
- [X] T003 [US1] Create the placeholder content file `docs/module2-digital-twin/chapter1-gazebo-simulation.mdx`.

**Checkpoint**: At this point, the basic structure for Module 2 and its first chapter should be in place and verifiable in the Docusaurus build.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Create Chapter 2 (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Create the placeholder file for the second chapter.
**Independent Test**: The Docusaurus site builds successfully, and a link to "Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Simulation with Unity" is visible and clickable in the sidebar.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T004 [P] [US2] Create the placeholder content file `docs/module2-digital-twin/chapter2-unity-simulation.mdx`.

**Checkpoint**: Chapter 2 placeholder is visible in the navigation.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Create Chapter 3 (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Create the placeholder file for the third chapter.
**Independent Test**: The Docusaurus site builds successfully, and a link to "Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation" is visible and clickable in the sidebar.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T005 [P] [US3] Create the placeholder content file `docs/module2-digital-twin/chapter3-sensor-simulation.mdx`.

**Checkpoint**: All three chapter placeholders are in place and navigable.

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final validation.

- [X] T006 Run `npm run build` to ensure the final Docusaurus site builds without any errors.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **User Stories (Phases 3-5)**: Depend on the foundational setup from Module 1 being complete. The story phases can be completed sequentially.
- **Polish (Phase N)**: Depends on all User Story phases being complete.

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Is the MVP for this module and blocks the others in terms of structural setup.
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1's structure being in place.
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US1's structure being in place.
