# Data Model for OpenAI Agent for RAG

This document defines the primary data structures used by the RAG agent. These are conceptual entities and will be represented as simple Python objects or dictionaries at runtime.

## 1. User Question

- **Description**: Represents the initial input from the user.
- **Fields**:
    - `text` (string, required): The plain text of the user's question.

## 2. Context Chunks

- **Description**: A collection of relevant text snippets retrieved from the vector database. This collection is used to ground the language model's response.
- **Fields**:
    - `chunks` (list of objects, required): A list where each object contains:
        - `text_chunk` (string): The text content of the snippet.
        - `source_url` (string): The original URL from which the text was extracted.
        - `score` (float): The relevance score from the vector search.

## 3. Grounded Answer

- **Description**: The final, synthesized response generated by the agent.
- **Fields**:
    - `answer_text` (string, required): The generated answer to the user's question. If no answer could be found, this will contain a predefined message stating so.
    - `sources` (list of strings, required): A list of the unique source URLs from the context chunks that were used to generate the answer.
