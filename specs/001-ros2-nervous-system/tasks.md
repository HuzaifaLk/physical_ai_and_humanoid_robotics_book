# Tasks: Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ros2-nervous-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Tests**: Not applicable for this structural setup. Validation will be done by building the site.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Paths shown below assume a Docusaurus project at the repository root.

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure.

- [X] T001 Initialize a new Docusaurus classic site in the current directory.
- [X] T002 [P] Install project dependencies using `npm install`.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete.

- [X] T003 Configure `docusaurus.config.js` with the project title ("AI-Spec-Driven Technical Book"), a basic navbar, and a footer.
- [X] T004 Create and configure `sidebars.js` to define a sidebar for the book, including an initial category for "Module 1: ROS 2". (Note: Opted for autogenerated sidebar based on directory structure).

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - Docusaurus is configured and ready for content.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create Module 1 Structure and Chapter 1 (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Create the directory structure for Module 1 and add the placeholder file for the first chapter, making it visible in the site navigation.
**Independent Test**: The Docusaurus site builds successfully (`npm run build`), and a link to "Chapter 1: Fundamentals" is visible and clickable in the sidebar under the "Module 1" category.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T005 [P] [US1] Create the directory `docs/module1-ros2-nervous-system`.
- [X] T006 [US1] Create the category file `docs/module1-ros2-nervous-system/_category_.json` to label the module "Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System".
- [X] T007 [US1] Create the placeholder content file `docs/module1-ros2-nervous-system/chapter1-fundamentals.mdx`.

**Checkpoint**: At this point, the basic structure for Module 1 and its first chapter should be in place and verifiable in the Docusaurus build.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Create Chapter 2 (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Create the placeholder file for the second chapter.
**Independent Test**: The Docusaurus site builds successfully, and a link to "Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy" is visible and clickable in the sidebar.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T008 [P] [US2] Create the placeholder content file `docs/module1-ros2-nervous-system/chapter2-python-agents.mdx`.

**Checkpoint**: Chapter 2 placeholder is visible in the navigation.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Create Chapter 3 (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Create the placeholder file for the third chapter.
**Independent Test**: The Docusaurus site builds successfully, and a link to "Chapter 3: Humanoid Structure with URDF" is visible and clickable in the sidebar.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T009 [P] [US3] Create the placeholder content file `docs/module1-ros2-nervous-system/chapter3-urdf-structure.mdx`.

**Checkpoint**: All three chapter placeholders are in place and navigable.

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final validation and setup for future work.

- [X] T010 Run `npm run build` to ensure the final Docusaurus site builds without any errors.
- [X] T011 Create `specs/001-ros2-nervous-system/quickstart.md` with instructions on how to install dependencies (`npm install`) and run the local development server (`npm run start`).
- [X] T012 [P] Add a placeholder section on the main Docusaurus landing page (`src/pages/index.js`) for the future embedded RAG chatbot.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: Must be completed first.
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion.
- **User Stories (Phases 3-5)**: Depend on Foundational phase completion. The story phases can be completed sequentially.
- **Polish (Phase N)**: Depends on all User Story phases being complete.

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Is the MVP and blocks the others in terms of structural setup.
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1's structure being in place.
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US1's structure being in place.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Once Phase 2 is complete, the creation of the three chapter files (T007, T008, T009) could theoretically happen in parallel, but the sequential order is simple enough for a single developer.
- The creation of the `quickstart.md` (T011) and the placeholder RAG section (T012) can be done in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

### Incremental Delivery

1.  **Complete Setup + Foundational**: This delivers an empty but functional Docusaurus site.
2.  **Add User Story 1**: The site now has the structure and first chapter for Module 1. This is the MVP.
3.  **Add User Stories 2 & 3**: The site now has the complete placeholder structure for Module 1.
4.  **Complete Polish**: The site is confirmed to build correctly, and a quickstart guide is available.

This approach ensures that a working, verifiable site is available at each stage of the setup process.
