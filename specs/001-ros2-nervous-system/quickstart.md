# Quickstart: Running the Docusaurus Site

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run the Docusaurus development server locally.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 18.0 or higher.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the local development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will open a browser window with the Docusaurus site running at `http://localhost:3000`. The site will automatically reload if you make changes to the source files.
